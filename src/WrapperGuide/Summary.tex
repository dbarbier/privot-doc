  \OT\ project: Coupling mechanisms with computational codes \\

  \emph{\fontshape{sc} Abstract}
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{center}

The purpose of this document is to present the latest features developed within the \OT\ library regarding the interfacing mechanism with a computational code.

The latest advances offer users:
\begin{itemize}
\item greater simplicity of implementation with the use of macros and shared functions that cover a large part of the expressed needs;
\item greater reliability, again thanks to these shared functions;
\item faster development by reducing the amount of programming required from the user;
\item simplified maintenance, again thanks to the reduction of the volume of code;
\item improved performance by using parallel techniques in a few relevant spots.
\end{itemize}
