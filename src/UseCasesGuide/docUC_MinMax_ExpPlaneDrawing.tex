The objective of this Use Case is to draw an experiment plane in dimension 2.\\


Details on each object may be found in the User Manual  (\href{OpenTURNS_UserManual_TUI.pdf}{see User Manual - Graphs / Cloud}).\\


\requirements{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] the points of an experiment plane : {\itshape mySample}
  \item[type:] a NumericalSample
  \end{description}
}
{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] the files containing the graph, in format .EPS, .FIG, .PNG : {\itshape experimentPlane}
  \item[type:] -
  \end{description}
}

Python script for this UseCase :


\begin{lstlisting}
  # Draw it
  mySampleDrawable = Cloud(mySample, "blue", "square", "My experiment Plane")
  graph = Graph("My experiment Plane", "x", "y", True)
  graph.addDrawable(mySampleDrawable)
  graph.draw("experimentPlane")
  ViewImage(graph.getBitmap())

  # In order to see the drawable without creating the associated files
  # CARE : it requires to have created the graph structure before
  Show(mySampleDrawable)
  # or to see the graph without creating the associated files
  Show(graph)
\end{lstlisting}
