The objective of this Use Case is to explicitate how to save the structures created within a study in order to be able to load them in a future study.\\


\index{Study!Save}
\requirements{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] none
  \end{description}
}
{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] an object containing all the objects saved : {\itshape myStudy}
  \item[type:] Study
  \item[$\bullet$]  a file .XML containing all the objects saved : {\itshape myXMLFile.XML}
  \item[type:] file .XML
  \end{description}
}

Python  script for this UseCase :

\begin{lstlisting}
  # Create the name of the file .XML which will be created at the adress /tmp
  # if the adress is not precised, the file .XML is created in the current repertory
  fileName = "/tmp/myXMLFile"

  # Create a Study Object which will contain all the objects saved
  myStudy = Study()

  # Associate it to the file .XML just created
  myStudy.setStorageManager(XMLStorageManager(fileName))

  # Perform here the study
  # for example, a NumericalPoint is created we want to save
  p1 = NumericalPointWithDescription( ( ("x",10.), ("y",11.), ("z",12.) ) )

  # Add the NumericalPoint to the list of the objects saved
  myStudy.add("point", p1)

  # Create an analytical NumericalMathFunction
  analytical = NumericalMathFunction( ("a", "b"), ("sum", "prod", "mean"), ("a+b", "a*b", "(a+b)/2") )

  # Add the NumericalMathFunction to the list of the objects saved
  myStudy.add("analytical", analytical)

  # Check the list of objects that will be saved
  print "Study = " , myStudy

  # Remove the NumericalMathFunction to the list of the objects saved
  myStudy.remove("analytical")

  # CARE!! At this point, no object has been saved : only the list have been written!
  # SAVE NOW the objects listed
  myStudy.save()
\end{lstlisting}
