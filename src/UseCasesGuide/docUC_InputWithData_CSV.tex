\index{CSV file}

The objective of this Use Case is to import a file at format CSV containing a list of data and to export a NumericalSample into a file at format CSV. \\



Details on each object may be found in the User Manual  (\href{OpenTURNS_UserManual_TUI.pdf}{see User Manual - Statistics on sample / Numerical Sample}).\\


To be a proper sample file, the following rules must be respected :
\begin{itemize}
\item Data are presented in line : each line corresponds to the realization of the random vector. The number of lines is the size of the sample. The number of data on each line is the dimension of the sample.
\item Data must be separated by the same specific character, ";" by default. To change the separator, you must use the ResourceMap class.
\item If a line does not have the same number of data as the first valid line in the file, it is disregarded.
\item The format of a data is either an integer value (2 or -5 for example), a floating-point value in decimal notation (-1.23 or 4.56 for example) or in scientific notation (-1.2e3 or 3.4e-5 for example).
\end{itemize}

When a line presents an error, the line is ignored but all the right ones are taken into account. The number of lines which don't follow the previous rules are signaled and the reason is given in the logs. To see then, you must use the Log class. There can be any number of white spaces or tabulations between the data and the separator, and the lines can be ended in a UNIX-like fashion or a Windows-like fashion.

Python script for this UseCase :

\begin{lstlisting}
  # IMPORT a CSV FILE

  # We give in argument of the static method ImportFromCSVFile()
  # the absolute adress of the file sampleFile.csv
  # for example : /tmp/sampleFile.csv
  # if only the name sampleFile.csv is fulfilled,
  # Open TURNS looks for the file in the current directory
  aSample = NumericalSample.ImportFromCSVFile("/tmp/sampleFile.csv")

  # To change the separator from its default value ";" to the value "|"
  ResourceMap.set("csv-file-separator", "|")

  # We give a name to the sample loaded
  aSample.setName("first data sample")

  # To see the warning messages
  Log.Show(Log.INFO)

  # EXPORT INTO A CSV FILE

  # We give in argument of the dynamic method exportToCSVFile
  # the absolute adress where the storing file mySampleStoredFile.csv
  # will be created
  # for example : /tmp/mySampleStoredFile.csv
  # if only the name mySampleStoredFile.csv is fulfilled,
  # Open TURNS creates the file in the current directory
  mySampleToBeStored.exportToCSVFile("/tmp/mySampleStoredFile.csv")
\end{lstlisting}
