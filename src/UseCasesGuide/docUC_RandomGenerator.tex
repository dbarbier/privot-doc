\index{Random Generator}

The seed of the random generator is automatically initialized to 0. It means that as soon as a the openturns session is launched, the sequence of random values generated within $[0,1]$ is the same one : if a script is launched several times, within different openturns session, the same results will be obtained. \\


Details on the random generator may be found in the Reference Guide (\href{OpenTURNS_ReferenceGuide.pdf}{see files Reference Guide - Step B -- Uniform Random Generator}).\\

Details on each object may be found in the User Manual  (\href{OpenTURNS_UserManual_TUI.pdf}{see User Manual - Threshold exceedance probability evaluation with simulation / RandomGenerator}).\\


Before any simulation, it is possible to initialise differently than the vaue y default or get the state of the random generator. \\
To initialize the random generator state, it is possible :
\begin{itemize}
\item to use an easy procedure thanks to the method {\itshape SetSeed()}  parameterized with an integer in $[0, 2^{32}-1]$ :
  \begin{itemize}
  \item to obtain a reproductible sequence of generated random values, we need to explicitely give a integer,
  \item to obtain a non reproductible sequence of generated random values (it means a new one each time the openturns sesion is launched), we can give a random integer, determined thanks to the time of the day or the number of the current python session.
  \end{itemize}
\item to specify a complete state of the random generator, generally previously obtained thanks to the {\itshape GetState()} method.
\end{itemize}


\begin{lstlisting}
  # INITIALISE THE RANDOM GENERATOR STATE

  # Case 1 : reproductible sequence of generated random vector
  # the seed is reproductible

  # Initialise the state of the random generator
  # thanks to the fonctionality SetSeed(n) where n is an UnsignedLong in [0, 2^(32)-1]
  # which enables an easy initialisation for the user
  RandomGenerator.SetSeed(77)

  # or by specifying a complete state of the random generator : particularState
  # coming from a previous particularState = RandomGenerator.GetState() :
  RandomGenerator.SetState(particularState)

  # Case 2 : non reproductible sequence of generated random vector
  # the seed is not reproductible

  # Example 1 : the number of the openturns python session
  from os import getpid
  RandomGenerator.SetSeed(getpid())

  # Example 2 : times of the moment
  from os import times
  RandomGenerator.SetSeed(int(100*times()[4]))


  # GET THE RANDOM GENERATOR STATE

  # Get the complete state of the random generator before simulation
  randomGeneratorStateBeforeRandomExperiment = RandomGenerator.GetState()
