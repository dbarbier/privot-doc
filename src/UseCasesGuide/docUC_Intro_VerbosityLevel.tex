It is possible to specify the verbosity level of the Open TURNS platform, through the object {\itshape Log} which contains the internal following variables :
\begin{itemize}
\item {\itshape Log.DBG} to catch the messages related the level debug,
\item {\itshape Log.WRAPPER} to catch the messages related to the wrapper,
\item {\itshape Log.INFO} to catch the messages related to the platform information,
\item {\itshape Log.USER} to catch the messages defined by the User,
\item {\itshape Log.WARN} to catch the messages related to warnings,
\item {\itshape Log.ERROR} to catch the messages related to errors.
\end{itemize}
By default, the Open TURNS platform shows all the messages related to the levels DBG, WARN and ERROR.\\
It is possible to change it by the command {\itshape Log.Show()}. For example to catch the messages related to the level debug, the warnings and information, the command is :
\begin{center}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    Log.Show(Log.DBG + Log.WARN + Log.INFO)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
In order to catch all the possible messages (highest verbosity level), the command is :
\begin{center}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    Log.Show(Log.ALL)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
In order to catch no message (lowest verbosity level), the command is :
\begin{center}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    Log.Show(Log.NONE)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
