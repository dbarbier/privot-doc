\index{Random Vector!Extracting a sub vector}

The objective of this Use Case is to extract a subvector from a random vector which has been defined as well  as a UsualRandomvector (it means thanks to a distribution, see UC. \ref{UsualRandomVector}) than  as a CompositeRandomVector (as the image through a limit state function of an input  random vector, see UC. \ref{CompositeRandomVector}).\\

Details on each object may be found in the User Manual  (\href{OpenTURNS_UserManual_TUI.pdf}{see User Manual - Probabilistic modeling / Random Vector}).\\



Let's note $\vect{Y} = (Y_1, \cdots, Y_n)$ a random vector and $I \subset [1, n]$ a set of indices :
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first case, the subvector is defined by $\vect{\tilde{Y}} = (Y_i)_{i \in I}$,
\item In the second case, where $\vect{Y} = f(\vect{X})$ with $f = (f_1, \cdots, f_n)$, $f_i$ some scalar functions, the sub vector is $\vect{\tilde{Y}} = (f_i(\vect{X}))_{i \in I}$.
\end{itemize}

Python script for this UseCase :


\begin{lstlisting}

  # CASE 1 : Get the marginal of the random vector
  # Corresponding to the component i

  # Care : numerotation begins at 0
  myExtractedRandomVector = myRandomVector.getMarginal(i)


  # CASE 2 : Get the marginals of the random vector
  # Corresponding to several components
  # decribed in the myIndice table
  # For example, components 0, 1, and 5

  myExtractedRandomVector = myRandomVector.getMarginal( (0, 1, 5) )
\end{lstlisting}
