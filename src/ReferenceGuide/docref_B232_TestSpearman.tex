\MathematicalDescription{

  \underline{\textbf{Goal}} \vspace{2mm}

  This method is concerned with the modelling of a probability distribution of a random vector $\vect{X} = \left( X^1,\ldots,X^{n_X} \right)$. It seeks to find a type of dependency (here a monotonous correlation) which may exist between two components $X^i$ and $X^j$. \vspace{2mm}

  \underline{\textbf{Principle}} \vspace{2mm}

  The Spearman's correlation coefficient  $\rho^S_{U,V}$, defined in \otref{docref_B232_Spearman}{Spearman's Coefficient}, measures the strength of a monotonous relationship between two random variables $U$ and $V$. If we have a sample made up of $N$ pairs $\left\{ (u_1,v_1),(u_2,v_2),(u_N,v_N) \right\}$, we denote $\widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V}$  to be the estimated coefficient.

  Even in the case where two variables $U$ and $V$ have a Spearman's coefficient  $\rho^S_{U,V}$ equal to zero, the estimate  $\widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V}$ obtained from the sample may be non-zero: the limited sample size does not provide the perfect image of the real correlation. Pearson's test nevertheless enables one to determine if the value obtained by $\widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V}$ is significantly different from zero. More precisely, the user first chooses a probability $\alpha$. From this value the critical value $d_\alpha$  is calculated automatically such that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item         if $\left| \widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V} \right| > d_\alpha$, one can conclude that the real Spearman's correlation coefficient $\rho^S_{U,V}$   is not zero; the risk of error in making this assertion is controlled and equal to $\alpha$;
  \item if $\left| \widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V} \right| \leq d_\alpha$, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis $\rho^S_{U,V} = 0$.
  \end{itemize}

  An important notion is the so-called "$p$-value" of the test. This quantity is equal to the limit error probability $\alpha_\textrm{lim}$ under which the null correlation hypothesis is rejected. Thus, Spearman's's coefficient is supposed non zero if and only if $\alpha_\textrm{lim}$ is greater than the value $\alpha$ desired by the user. Note that the higher $\alpha_\textrm{lim} - \alpha$, the more robust the decision.

\Methodology{
  The Spearman's test is used in step B "Quantifying Sources of Uncertainty". It enables us to verify if a monotonous type of dependency exists between the two components $X^i$ and $X^j$ of the input variable vector $\underline{X}$ defined in step A "Specifying Criteria and the Case Study". Such a relationship should in fact be taken into account to avoid distortion of results in step C "Propagation of Uncertainty".

  {\bf Input data~:}\\
  Two samples $\left\{ x^i_1,\ldots,x^i_N \right\}$  and $\left\{ x^j_1,\ldots,x^j_N \right\}$  of variables $X^i$ and $X^j$, each pair $\left( x^i_k,x^j_k \right)$  corresponding to a simultaneous sampling of the two variables

  {\bf Parameters~:}\\
  a probability $\alpha$ taking values strictly between 0 and 1, defining the risk of permissible decision error (significance level)

  {\bf Outputs~:}\\
  $Result$ : Binary variable specifying whether the hypothesis of a correlation coefficient equal to 0 is rejected (0) or not (1) \\
  $\alpha_\textrm{lim}$ : $p$-value of the test

  Certain precautions should be taken when interpreting the Spearman's test results.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Remember that  $\rho_{X^i,X^j}= 0$ does not enable us to conclude that $X^i$ and $X^j$ are independent (see \otref{docref_B232_Spearman}{Spearman's correlation coefficient}).
  \item More generally, the numerical value of Spearman's correlation coefficient can only be interpreted when the two variables studied $X^i$ and $X^j$ are related in a monotonous way; the scatter plot of points $\left\{ (x^i_1,x^j_1),\ldots,(x^i_N,x^j_N) \right\}$  provides some indication concerning the validity of this hypothesis.
