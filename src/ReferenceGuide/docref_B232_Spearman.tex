\MathematicalDescription{

  \underline{\textbf{Goal}} \vspace{2mm}

  This method is concerned with the parametric modelling of a probability distribution for a random vector $\vect{X} = \left( X^1,\ldots,X^{n_X} \right)$. It aims to measure a type of dependence (here a monotonous correlation) which may exist between two components $X^i$ and $X^j$.\vspace{2mm}

  \underline{\textbf{Principle}} \vspace{2mm}

  The Spearman's correlation coefficient $\rho^S_{U,V}$  aims to measure the strength of a monotonic relationship between two random variables $U$ and $V$. It is in fact equivalent to the Pearson's correlation coefficient after having transformed $U$ and $V$ to linearize any monotonic relationship (remember that Pearson's correlation coefficient may only be used to measure the strength of linear relationships, see \otref{docref_B231_Pearson}{Pearson's Correlation Coefficient}):
  $$
  \rho^S_{U,V} = \rho_{F_U(U),F_V(V)}
  $$
  where $F_U$ and $F_V$ denote the cumulative distribution functions of $U$ and $V$.

  If we arrange a sample made up of $N$ pairs  $\left\{ (u_1,v_1),(u_2,v_2),\ldots,(u_N,v_N) \right\}$, the estimation of Spearman's correlation coefficient first of all requires a ranking to produce two samples $(u_1,\ldots,u_N)$ and $(v_1,\ldots,v_N)$. The ranking $u_{[i]}$ of the observation $u_i$ is defined as the position of $u_i$ in the sample reordered in ascending order: if $u_i$ is the smallest value in the sample $(u_1,\ldots,u_N)$, its ranking would equal 1; if $u_i$ is the second smallest value in the sample, its ranking would equal 2, and so forth. The ranking transformation is a procedure that takes the sample $(u_1,\ldots,u_N)$) as input data and produces the sample $(u_{[1]},\ldots,u_{[N]})$ as an output result.

  For example, let us consider the sample $(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4) = (1.5,0.7,5.1,4.3)$. We therefore have $(u_{[1]},u_{[2]}u_{[3]},u_{[4]}) = (2,1,4,3)$. $u_1 = 1.5$ is in fact the second smallest value in the original, $u_2 = 0.7$ the smallest, etc.

  The estimation of Spearman's correlation coefficient is therefore equal to Pearson's coefficient estimated with the aid of the $N$ pairs $(u_{[1]},v_{[1]})$, $(u_{[2]},v_{[2]})$, \ldots, $(u_{[N]},v_{[N]})$:
  $$
  \widehat{\rho}^S_{U,V} = \frac{ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \left( u_{[i]} - \overline{u}_{[]} \right) \left( v_{[i]} - \overline{v}_{[]} \right) }{ \sqrt{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \left( u_{[i]} - \overline{u}_{[]} \right)^2 \left( v_{[i]} - \overline{v}_{[]} \right)^2} }
  $$
  where $\overline{u}_{[]}$ and  $\overline{v}_{[]}$ represent the empirical means of the samples $(u_{[1]},\ldots,u_{[N]})$ and $(v_{[1]},\ldots,v_{[N]})$.

  The Spearman's correlation coefficient takes values between -1 and 1. The closer its absolute value is to 1, the stronger the indication is that a monotonic relationship exists between variables $U$ and $V$. The sign of Spearman's coefficient indicates if the two variables increase or decrease in the same direction (positive coefficient) or in opposite directions (negative coefficient). We note that a correlation coefficient equal to 0 does not necessarily imply the independence of variables $U$ and $V$. There are two possible situations in the event of a zero Spearman's correlation coefficient:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the variables $U$ and $V$ are in fact independent,
  \item or a non-monotonic relationship exists between $U$ and $V$.
  \end{itemize}

  Spearman's coeeficient is often referred to as the rank correlation coefficient.

\Methodology{
  Spearman's correlation coefficient can be used in step B "Quantifying Sources of Uncertainty". Having defined the vector $\underline{X}$ of input variables in step A "Specifying Criteria and the Case Study", \otref{docref_B232_TestSpearman}{Spearman's Independence Test} shows how to test for the existence of a monotonous type of dependency between two components $X^i$ and $X^j$.
  Such a relationship should in fact be taken in to account so as not to falsify the results of step C "Propagation of Uncertainty".

  Spearman's correlation coefficient is also used in step C' "Sensitivity Analysis and Ranking of Sources of Uncertainty". If a propagation of uncertainty with Monte-Carlo simulation (step C, \otref{docref_C221_MonteCarloStd}{Mean and Variance Estimation using Standard Monte Carlo}) has been carried out, \otref{docref_Cprime212_Spearman}{Spearman's Ranking} shows the user how to class the components of the input vector $\underline{X}$ according to their impact on the uncertainty of a final variable / output variable defined in step A.

  Regardless of the method used in step B or step C', we recall that the Spearman's coefficient is only useful in measuring a monotonous relationship between two variables. Readers are referred to the following references:
