\MathematicalDescription{
  \underline{\textbf{Goal}} \vspace{2mm}

  This method is concerned with analyzing the influence the random vector $\vect{X} = \left( X^1,\ldots,X^{n_X} \right)$ has on a random variable $Y^j$ which is being studied for uncertainty. Here we attempt to measure monotonic relationships that exist between $Y^j$ and the different components $X^i$. \vspace{2mm}

  \underline{\textbf{Principle}} \vspace{2mm}

  Spearman's correlation coefficient  $\rho^S_{Y^j,X^i}$, defined in \otref{docref_B232_Spearman}{Spearman's Coefficient}, measures the strength of a monotonic relation between two random variables $Y^j$ and $X^i$. If we have a sample made up of $N$ pairs $(y^j_1,x^i_1)$, $(y^j_2,x^i_2)$, \ldots, $(y^j_N,x^i_N)$, we can obtain  $\widehat{\rho}^S_{Y^j,X^i}$ an estimation of Spearman's coefficient.

  Hierarchical ordering using Spearman's coefficients is concerned with the case where the variable $Y^j$ monotonically depends on the $n_X$ variables $\left\{ X^1,\ldots,X^{n_X} \right\}$. To obtain an indication of the role played by each $X^i$ in the dispersion of $Y^j$, the idea is to estimate the Spearman correlation coefficients  $\widehat{\rho}^S_{X^i,Y^j}$ for each $i$. One can then order the $n_X$ variables $X^1,\ldots, X^{n_X}$ taking absolute values of the Spearman coefficients: the higher the value of  $\left| \widehat{\rho}^S_{X^i,Y^j} \right|$, the greater the impact the variable $X^i$ has on the dispersion of $Y^j$.

\Methodology{
  After a propagation of uncertainty (step C) using \otref{docref_C221_MonteCarloStd}{Standard Monte Carlo} simulation, a hierarchy of sources of uncertainty can be obtained using Spearman's correlation coefficients. In fact, the $N$ simulations enable the pairs  $(y^j_1, x^i_1)$, $(y^j_2, x^i_2)$,\ldots, $(y^j_N, x^i_N)$ to be generated, where:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\underline{X} = \left\{ X^1,\ldots,X^n \right\}$ describes the input vector specified in  step A "Specifying Criteria and the Case Study",
  \item $Y^j$ describes the final variable of interest or output variable defined in the same step.
  \end{itemize}

  The results produced as output of this method are the estimated Spearman's correlation coefficients $\widehat{\rho}^S_{X^i,Y^j}$ that the user may use, taking absolute values, to order the variables $X^i$ hierarchically.
}
{
  This method of hierarchical ordering is particularly useful:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item when the study of uncertainty is concerned with the central dispersion of the variable of interest $Y^j$ and not with its extreme values,
  \item when the relationships between $Y^j$ and each of the components of $\underline{X}$ are monotonic relationships (so that Spearman's correlation coefficient can be interpreted),
  \item when the components of vector $\underline{X}$ are statistically independent. If this is not the case, $\left| \widehat{\rho}^S_{X^i,Y^j} \right|$  reflects not only the influence of $X^i$ on $Y^j$ but equally the influence of  other variables $X^j$ related to $X^i$ (e.g. an unimportant variable $X^i$ could have a strong coefficient for the correlation with $Y^j$ only because it is related to another variable $X^j$ which has enormous impact on $Y^j$).
  \end{itemize}
